Configuring and Running a Simple Neural Network: Binary Classification

The following example illustrates the most important points of configuring, running, and assessing the performance of a NN.  
This example uses binary classification, meaning that the network will categorize the output layer into whether the customer dropped their credit card or not.  Other architectures with neural networks are possible, including multicategorical classification and numeric estimation.
